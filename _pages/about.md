I am a postdoc in [LIAM (Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics)](https://liam.lab.yorku.ca/) at York University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jianhong Wu](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Ox-xAuIAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Wilfrid Laurier University, hosted by [Prof. Yuming Chen](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/yuming-chen/index.html). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Nanjing University
of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Zhipeng Qiu. 

My research focuses on mathematical modeling, dynamical systems, and theoretical immunology.
